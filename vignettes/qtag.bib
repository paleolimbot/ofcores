	abstract = {{TGView} is a Windows (95 and above) program that views and prints *.tgf files generated by the {DOS} version of Tilia*Graph. The program will read *.tgf files versions 1.10 through 1.26. An important feature of the program is that it will print to any printer supported by Windows. Because {DOS} drivers do not exist for many newer printers, this feature alleviates a major shortcoming of Tilia*Graph. The program also uses Windows {TrueType} fonts. {TGView} is the first step in the production of the full Tilia*Graph for Windows.},
